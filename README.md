## These files were not all added straight from google colab because of this it takes a different step to open them in google colab - you can also clone the repo to your local drive and open them there 

- To open ipynb file straight from the git repo these three options should work fine the easiest method is to clone the repositiory in colab. For me the easiest was to modify the url of the ipynb file you are located in url and hit the enter key. Then follow the instructions to open the notebook in google colab.
  
- Modify the URL:

    Take the GitHub URL of your notebook (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository/blob/master/notebook.ipynb).
    Replace "github.com" with "githubtocolab.com" in the URL.
    Open this new URL in your browser to access the notebook in Colab.
- Use the Colab interface:

    Go to https://colab.research.google.com/.
    Click on "GitHub" in the "Open notebook" section.
    Enter your GitHub repository URL.
    Select the notebook you want to open.
- Clone the repository in Colab:

    Open a new Colab notebook.
    Use the !git clone command to clone your GitHub repository.
    Navigate to the cloned directory using %cd.
    Open the notebook using !jupyter nbconvert --to notebook notebook.ipynb.
