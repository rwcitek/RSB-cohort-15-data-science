Feature Selection and Model Improvement

    Lasso Regression Advantages:
        Eliminate features with coefficients close to zero
        Run model again with reduced features
        Helps identify unnecessary variables

    Project Progress:
        Current version: ~4-5
        Original MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was earlier

    Data Analysis Steps:
        Correlation matrix analysis
        Linear regression
        Residual analysis (required for project 2)
        QQ plot analysis

    Model Improvement Techniques:
        Box-Cox transformation on target variable
        Helps address non-linear relationships

    Key Takeaways:
        Feature selection improves model efficiency
        Residual analysis is crucial for understanding model fit
        Non-linear transformations may be necessary for better model performance
