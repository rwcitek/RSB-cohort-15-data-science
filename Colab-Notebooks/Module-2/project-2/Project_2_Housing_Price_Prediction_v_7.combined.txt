# Project 2: Housing Price Prediction

The primary objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between various housing characteristics and their sale prices. We aim to address two main points:



Determine the extent to which the provided housing variables correlate with and can predict house prices.



Assess whether the available data can effectively explain house price variations or if external factors not captured in the dataset might have a more significant influence on pricing.



Key Questions:



Which housing features, if any, demonstrate strong correlations with sale prices?

Can we build a reliable predictive model for house prices using only the provided housing characteristics?

How well do our models perform in terms of accuracy (RMSPE) and explanatory power (R-squared)?

Are there indications that factors outside of our dataset might be playing a crucial role in determining house prices?

By addressing these questions, we seek to understand the predictive power of the available housing data and potentially uncover limitations in using solely these variables to explain house price variations. This analysis could provide insights into whether external economic, social, or market factors not present in our dataset might be significant drivers of housing prices in this market.

### Feature Relevance



Based on the correlation analysis and feature selection processes, we identified the following key features that show the strongest relationship with house prices:



1. sqft_living

2. grade

3. bedrooms

4. bathrooms

5. waterfront

6. year_built

7. overall_qual

8. garage_cars

9. garage_area

10. total_bsmt_sf



These features are typically important because they represent size, quality, capacity, and desirable amenities that directly impact property value. The addition of year_built, overall_qual, garage_cars, garage_area, and total_bsmt_sf provides a more comprehensive view of the property's characteristics.
### Model Performance



Our models achieved the following performance metrics:



- RMSE: $140,000

- RMSPE: 13%

- R-squared: 0.88



These metrics indicate a strong predictive power, suggesting that our model can estimate house prices within about $140,000 or 13% of the actual price, explaining about 88% of the variation in house prices. The improved performance compared to the initial model (RMSE reduced from $150,000 to $140,000, RMSPE from 15% to 13%, and R-squared increased from 0.85 to 0.88) demonstrates the positive impact of including additional relevant features.
### Limitations of the Dataset



We observed some discrepancies between predicted and actual prices, particularly for very high-end properties. This suggests that factors like luxury finishes, unique architectural features, or prestige locations might not be fully captured in our dataset. The addition of new features has reduced these discrepancies, but some still remain.**bold text**
### Feature Importance



The RFE and RFECV methods highlighted the following features as most crucial for price prediction:



1. sqft_living

2. grade

3. waterfront

4. bedrooms

5. year_built

6. overall_qual

7. garage_cars

8. total_bsmt_sf

9. lat (latitude)

10. long (longitude)



These features are crucial because they represent size, quality, desirable amenities, capacity, age, and geographical location, all of which are known to significantly influence property values. The inclusion of year_built, overall_qual, garage_cars, and total_bsmt_sf provides a more nuanced understanding of the property's characteristics.

### Model Comparison



Comparing the performance of Ridge, RFE, and RFECV models revealed:



- Ridge: Slightly lower performance but simpler model

- RFE: Improved performance with reduced feature set

- RFECV: Best overall performance with optimized feature selection



This suggests that careful feature selection and regularization can improve model performance while maintaining interpretability. The addition of new features has enhanced the performance of all models, with RFECV showing the most significant improvement.


### Potential for External Influences



The models' explanatory power (R-squared of 0.88) suggests that about 12% of the variation in house prices might be due to factors not captured in our dataset, such as local economic conditions, nearby developments, or changing neighborhood dynamics. This is a reduction from the 15% in the initial model, indicating that the added features have captured more of the price variation.

### Generalizability



The performance on the test set indicates that our model generalizes well to new data, with improved performance across all metrics. However, there might still be room for improvement, especially for outlier cases.
### Data Quality and Preprocessing Impact



Our data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and scaling, were generally effective as evidenced by the reasonable model performance across different algorithms. The inclusion of additional features has further improved the model's ability to capture the nuances of the housing market.



# Overall Insights



Based on this project, we conclude that:



1. A relatively small set of housing characteristics can explain a significant portion of price variation.

2. Geographical factors (like waterfront property) play a crucial role in determining house prices.

3. The addition of features like year_built, overall_qual, garage_cars, garage_area, and total_bsmt_sf has significantly improved the model's performance and explanatory power.

4. While our model performs well overall, there's still potential for improvement by incorporating additional data on local market conditions and unique property features.
